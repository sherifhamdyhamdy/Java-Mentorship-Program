# Vacation Tracking System

## üìå Vision

The **Vacation Tracking System** empowers employees to independently manage their vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off. System eliminates the need for users to be experts in company or facility-specific leave policies by streamlining leave requests and approvals through a centralized, rules-based system.
